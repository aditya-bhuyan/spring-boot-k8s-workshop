= Building a Spring Boot Application

== Learning Outcomes
After completing the lab, you will be able to:

 . Describe how to create runnable Spring Boot application
 . Describe how to create a controller that responds to HTTP requests
 . Use gradle to run gradle tasks
 
The pages codebase contains a local Git repository with the starting points and the solutions for all the labs in this unit. Download the linked zip file and extract the codebase in the ~/workspace directory. The extracted directory will contains a single text file as well as the (hidden) Git files. You will be building up the code in this directory bit by bit, and we have provided reference implementations at each stage identified by tags in the Git repository. Take some time to navigate through the tags and branches using the following command: 
   
   git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all
